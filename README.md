# Enhanced Driver Assistance: Emergency Vehicle Detection (Vision-Only)

Lightweight computer-vision approach to detect emergency vehicles (fire, ambulance, police) and their **active status** (lightbar on/off) from images. Built around YOLOv8n and curated datasets; goal is real-time driver assistance on constrained hardware.

## Highlights
- Two-model design tested: vehicle detector + lightbar detector (sequential and parallel setups).
- YOLOv8n chosen for speed/accuracy trade-off; YOLOv11 was ~10Ã— slower in our tests.
- ~2.6k images corrected/relabeled; augmentations to improve robustness.
- Key limitation: single-frame vision (no temporal cues), class imbalance.

## Data
We use public datasets for emergency vehicles, siren lights, and snowplows. We **do not** redistribute raw data.
