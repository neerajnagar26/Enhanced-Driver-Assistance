- Intended use: driver assistance research, not safety-critical deployment.

- Data: sources, class balance, labeling process.

- Limitations: single-frame vision, class imbalance, snow context leakage.

- Ethics/safety: false negatives for sirens; potential bias across regions; do not use for autonomous control.

- Future work: video/temporal features, more balanced data, domain expansion.
